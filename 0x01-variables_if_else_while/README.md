# Variables, if...else, while

* A **variable** is basically a tagged space in memory allocated for a piece of data. The data has a type and name/identifier.

* The **if...else** clause is one of the control structure that controls the flow of how a program is executed.

* **while** is one of the loop stuctures that runs as long as the condition being tested for is true
